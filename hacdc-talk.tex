  From \href{http://www.hacdc.org}{hacdc.org}:
  \begin{quote}
    HacDC is a non-profit organization and space dedicated to
    technical, artistic and social collaboration. We are
    technologists, tinkerers, crafters and codemonkeys who call DC
    home. We collaborate across disciplines for the benefit of
    cultural, charitable and scientific causes. We create, learn and
    teach as a group, inviting our neighbors around the block and
    around the world to join us.
